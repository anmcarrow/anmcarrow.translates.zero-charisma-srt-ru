1
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,700
Zero Charisma

2
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:16,580
Having a party?

3
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,180
You could say that.

4
00:01:24,257 --> 00:01:27,880
What is it, like your nephew's birthday or something?

5
00:01:27,886 --> 00:01:30,390
No!

6
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:41,210
That will be 12 dollars and 53 cents.

7
00:01:50,427 --> 00:01:53,420
You saved 2 dollars and 51 cents today.

8
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:56,130
Mrs. Weidemeyer.

9
00:01:56,605 --> 00:01:59,100
Wiedemeyer.

10
00:02:06,855 --> 00:02:10,160
I can't wait for you guys to see what i have in store for you guys tonight...

11
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,420
You're gonna shit!

12
00:02:11,426 --> 00:02:12,690
What is it?

13
00:02:12,692 --> 00:02:15,020
I'm not gonna tell you idiot, that would spoil it.

14
00:02:15,026 --> 00:02:17,510
No, no of course not.

15
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:19,720
Alright i will give you a hint.

16
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:24,070
You may want to stock up on your fire enchantments before you leave the village.

17
00:02:24,074 --> 00:02:25,610
Is it a flame golem ?

18
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,640
A flame golem? Are you Serious?

19
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,740
Or maybe it's a...

20
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:32,710
No, you said a flame golem. Is that what you think it is?

21
00:02:32,712 --> 00:02:34,500
Well is it ?

22
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,590
Let's concider it for a second, shall we?

23
00:02:36,594 --> 00:02:38,800
Uh, you're walking across the cursed flats.

24
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:41,610
When you come across a flame golem.

25
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:44,800
Ten feet of animated lava, ready to kick your ass.

26
00:02:44,806 --> 00:02:47,500
So you cast a fire enchantment on it,

27
00:02:47,507 --> 00:02:50,400
Which is immediatly absorbed into it's body,

28
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,610
Thereby increasing it's strength and stamina...

29
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:53,910
Oh! Right, yeah i...

30
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:56,980
No, Let me finish! And giving it a bonus on all of it's attack rolls.

31
00:02:56,988 --> 00:02:58,180
How is that working out for you?

32
00:02:58,188 --> 00:03:00,960
You're right, that would be stupid, Scott. I'm sorry.

33
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:03,560
Jesus...

34
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:08,760
Guess again.

35
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,060
Martin, your elf takes 22 damage,

36
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,110
All spellcasters regain 3 spell slots.

37
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,210
New round. Everyone roll for your action orders, and state your intentions.

38
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,590
Is your blessing still in effect?

39
00:03:20,594 --> 00:03:21,780
Two more rounds.

40
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,650
Eight. I'm healing this round.

41
00:03:23,656 --> 00:03:24,930
Okay.

42
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:26,390
Three.

43
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:29,070
Five. I am attacking the troll with my warhammer.

44
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,010
He is still paralized by my grand flash spell.

45
00:03:31,013 --> 00:03:31,440
Sweetness!

46
00:03:31,448 --> 00:03:33,110
12 to hit.

47
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,340
15.

48
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,830
And... 10 damage.

49
00:03:38,778 --> 00:03:40,880
Vronkar's final blow...

50
00:03:40,882 --> 00:03:42,880
crushes the troll's skull.

51
00:03:42,885 --> 00:03:47,020
As he crumbles into a bloody, smelly heap.

52
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:47,230
The captain...

53
00:03:47,237 --> 00:03:51,530
Say hello to my little friend.

54
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,980
The captain of the guard approaches...

55
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:55,130
I'm healing.

56
00:03:55,131 --> 00:03:55,370
I know!

57
00:03:55,377 --> 00:03:59,410
The captain of the guards approaches.

58
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:01,570
"Thank you my friends"

59
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:03,770
"My people are safe"

60
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:05,150
"For now..."

61
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,660
"In return i give you this information about the stones of light you are seeking"

62
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,240
Oh, isn't that special?

63
00:04:11,244 --> 00:04:14,050
Wayne!

64
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:19,680
"This was no mere band of leaderless trolls"

65
00:04:19,688 --> 00:04:22,770
"The rumor among..."

66
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,210
"The rumor amongst my people, is that they serve the goblin queen"

67
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,180
"Of the Ungar mountains"

68
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:31,880
She's the one that stole the stones from Porthaven, right?

69
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:36,220
"Indeed. She lives in a dark tower to the east,

70
00:04:36,226 --> 00:04:39,150
from whence she commands her bloodthirty troops"

71
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:41,420
"By night, she..."

72
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,780
"Terrorizes the countryside"

73
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,470
"Disguised as a wil..."

74
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,650
Scott!

75
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:47,400
What?

76
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:50,030
Come here and open this jar.

77
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,003
Goddamnit!

78
00:04:53,003 --> 00:04:55,660
You screw the lids on too tight.

79
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:59,350
Hey! I need you to take me to the pharmacy tomorrow.

80
00:04:59,358 --> 00:05:00,420
Okay, fine.

81
00:05:00,427 --> 00:05:02,390
But not the one on fifth.

82
00:05:02,392 --> 00:05:04,590
A gal works in there, i don't know where she's from...

83
00:05:04,598 --> 00:05:07,130
But i don't understand a word she says.

84
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:09,060
And then she give's me grief, like it's my fault

85
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:11,140
she can't understand english.

86
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,010
And i need you to mow the lawn.

87
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,720
Hey, Wayne, Martin and i fishined the latest

88
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:20,140
episode of Blood Brigade. Wanna see it?

89
00:05:20,147 --> 00:05:21,780
Well i wouldn't say that it's finished.

90
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:24,180
We still have some sound mixing to do before we upload it.

91
00:05:24,188 --> 00:05:26,880
Thats fine.

92
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:29,590
Straigten up, Rodriguez.

93
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:34,620
If those blood suckers get in here, i need to know that you're 100%!

94
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,120
But sarge, what we have seen..

95
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,610
Get a grip private!

96
00:05:38,615 --> 00:05:43,160
I didn't survive the zombie outbreak and the wherewolf apocalypse to give up now.

97
00:05:43,164 --> 00:05:46,640
Sarge! They are breaking through!

98
00:05:46,641 --> 00:05:49,170
God help us all!

99
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:53,390
Let's rock and roll!

100
00:05:56,102 --> 00:05:58,140
And clean out the car before then.

101
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,100
It's like a dumpster on wheels.

102
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,140
Nana, you promised you wouldn't disturb the game.

103
00:06:02,145 --> 00:06:05,140
I'm not disturbing the game, i'm just making myself a sandwich.

104
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:06,650
well, it's disturbing.

105
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:11,050
No, you and you friends, sitting in there pretending to be elfs and fairies and shit,

106
00:06:11,057 --> 00:06:12,690
that's what's disturbing.

107
00:06:12,694 --> 00:06:15,390
Just stay in your room, okay?

108
00:06:15,396 --> 00:06:16,900
Listen mister!

109
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:22,410
This is my house and my kitchen, and i'll come into it whenever i damn well please.

110
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:22,860
Okay.

111
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:27,260
And you can take the fucking nerd herd someplace else if you don't like it.

112
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:30,970
Put that stuff back in the fridge.

113
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:37,720
Shelley, honey, we talked about this last night.

114
00:06:37,727 --> 00:06:40,920
You... you said everything was okay!

115
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:43,830
I... i realize that. You told me everything was okay...

116
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:45,170
Kenny, we're back.

117
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,070
Go ahead, i'll be there in a sec.

118
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:49,640
Uh no, we are in the middle of an important plot point.

119
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:51,290
No, Shelley, i dont wanna talk about this later

120
00:06:51,299 --> 00:06:52,940
I wanna talk now... No.

121
00:06:52,948 --> 00:06:58,370
No, no, no, please, please... don't hang, if you hang up i swear to god...

122
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,180
Damnit!

123
00:07:07,036 --> 00:07:10,530
Shelley wants to separate.

124
00:07:13,176 --> 00:07:15,780
Yesterday everything was fine.

125
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,880
Today...

126
00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:41,700
Tell you what.

127
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,010
We'll take our five now.

128
00:07:45,656 --> 00:07:49,730
That should give you some time to pull yourself together.

129
00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:54,760
And we'll start up again at 20:45, okay?

130
00:07:55,535 --> 00:07:57,750
Sorry Scott.

131
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,370
But i don't think i can play anymore.

132
00:08:00,373 --> 00:08:02,570
Sure you can!

133
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:08,050
No. No, i have to go.

134
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,780
But it's only 20:30!

135
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,860
What's going on?

136
00:08:15,864 --> 00:08:17,700
Nothing. Kenny's wife is leaving him.

137
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:20,400
But we're starting up early on thursday to make up for lost time.

138
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:24,900
No, Scott, i dont think i can play anymore at all!

139
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:27,540
What are you talking about?

140
00:08:27,547 --> 00:08:32,520
I can't lose my wife, Okay? And that means making a lot of changes.

141
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,020
You're leaving the game?

142
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:35,350
This is crazy!

143
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:39,100
We've been playing one continues adventure for three years,

144
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:41,700
And now you're just gonna flush it all down the toilet?

145
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,700
What else can i do? We barely see each other as is.

146
00:08:44,704 --> 00:08:46,800
But we're almost through the hall of the goblin queen!

147
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:48,540
I just hope she'll still talk to me.

148
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,040
Of course she will! She sent you the gnome to give you the map!

149
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:54,640
Not the goblin queen, Scott. My wife!

150
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:57,810
Look, i dont expect you to understand.

151
00:08:57,813 --> 00:08:59,580
Okay?

152
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,310
You've never even had a girlfriend.

153
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:07,420
Yeah because i don't like to be tied down. How many times do i have to say that?

154
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:14,300
I'll leave my character so you can play him as an NPC.

155
00:09:14,778 --> 00:09:17,910
Kenny, wait, wait, wait, just hear me out.

156
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,220
We have know each other for a long time.

157
00:09:20,222 --> 00:09:23,570
and i say this as a friend.

158
00:09:23,573 --> 00:09:28,090
Shelley is a bitch.

159
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:33,170
Goodbye Scott.

160
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:43,140
NPC? Borgus the mighty is fucking dead!

161
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,430
Hey Tim, it's Scott Wiedemeyer.

162
00:09:57,436 --> 00:09:59,770
Listen, i've got some great news for you.

163
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:01,940
I had to let one of my players go today...

165

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,730

167
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:13,230
Hello?

168
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:15,530

171
00:10:17,823 --> 00:10:21,320

00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:23,850
We have an open seat starting tuesday.

173
00:10:23,851 --> 00:10:25,420
Okay, if you apologize.

174
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,830
Apologize for what?

175
00:10:26,838 --> 00:10:28,080
You know what.

176
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:31,790
Brian Dumbledore is a homo it's a fact.

177
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,550
Brian?

178
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:36,490
Hello.

179
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:38,990

180
00:10:38,993 --> 00:10:40,830
May i ask who's calling?

181
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:42,260
Scott Wiedemeyer.

182
00:10:42,264 --> 00:10:43,760
Well, he doesn't want to speak to you Scott.

183
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:44,766
Why not?

184
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,100
Because you made him cry.

185
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,480
Well, frankly Mrs.Prendergast, Eric's a crybaby.

186
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,260
And everybody knows it.

187
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:56,570
Mrs. Prendergast? Shit!

188
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:57,980
Fuck.

189
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:08,030
I see that.

190
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:15,460
Video games are amazing these days, arn't they?

191
00:11:15,469 --> 00:11:19,130
Beautiful artwork. Expansive worlds.

192
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:21,390
Top notch voice talent.

193
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,080
Rolling dice is just a thing of the past, right?

194
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:24,930
Right?

195
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:25,580
Wrong.

196
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,920
It's all a facada.

197
00:11:26,926 --> 00:11:31,230
We think it's a RPG, But you might as well be playing connect the fucking dots.

198
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,930
And i'll tell you why.

199
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:35,530
No human interaction.

200
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:37,670
When we play tabletop RPG's ...

201
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:40,400
We are reawakening one of man's oldest traditions.

202
00:11:40,402 --> 00:11:41,550
Games.

203
00:11:41,555 --> 00:11:43,280
No.

204
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,390
Communal storytelling

205
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,830
Just as thousands of years ago...

206
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,630
Early man gathered around the fire.

207
00:11:51,635 --> 00:11:55,610
Developing the myth's that define their culture...

208
00:11:55,618 --> 00:11:57,940
So we sit at the table,

209
00:11:57,946 --> 00:11:59,500
Building worlds,

210
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:01,840
Building characters,

211
00:12:01,845 --> 00:12:04,440
Building hero's.

212
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:07,900
Seeing through them as through a prism,

213
00:11:46,390 --> 00:12:09,850
Our own fears,

214
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,050
Our own goals,

215
00:12:13,058 --> 00:12:15,560
Ourselves.

216
00:12:15,562 --> 00:12:19,050
Think your Xbox can do that?

217
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,560
I don't have an Xbox.

218
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:21,270
Good for you.

219
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:25,470
I play world of warcraft though.

220
00:12:26,644 --> 00:12:28,580
Let me tell you something.

221
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,180
MMORPG's are fucking garbage!

222
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:34,450
They turn fibrant, creative people, into drooling zombies

223
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,380
who sit in front of their monitors

224
00:12:36,385 --> 00:12:39,480
jabbing F1 until their fucking hearts explode.

225
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:43,980
Take your character sheet and go back to farmville!

226
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,180
Alright, who else do we have for today?

227
00:12:53,183 --> 00:12:55,910
Uhh... that was it.

228
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,150
Are you kidding? One goddamn applicant?

229
00:12:58,154 --> 00:13:01,030
Scott, your break's over.

230
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,120
Alright.

231
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,320
Get more flyers printed, we'll put them up tomorrow.

232
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:04,630
Okay.

233
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,690
Now, Scott! You got a delivery!

234
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:09,050
Bye Scott.

235
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:11,770
You know, Mrs. Yi, when you screech like that,

236
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:15,770
it only reinforces negative stereotypes about chinese women.

237
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:19,180
And when you sit on your fat ass, not walking,

238
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,880
you reinforce stereotypes about american men.

239
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,730
Shit!

240
00:13:50,225 --> 00:13:53,120
Psst! Pete!

241
00:13:55,065 --> 00:13:56,920
Scott!

242
00:13:56,923 --> 00:13:58,930
They sent you again man?

243
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:01,500
I'm the only one that makes deliveries, i told you that last time.

244
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:03,110
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.

245
00:14:03,113 --> 00:14:05,260
You're the operational manager

246
00:14:05,268 --> 00:14:08,370
Of all external food distribution, right?

247
00:14:08,373 --> 00:14:11,330
It's just temporary. Until i find a publisher.

248
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,400
Nathan.

249
00:14:12,403 --> 00:14:12,840
Scott.

250
00:14:12,849 --> 00:14:16,120
So you have the dragonheart sets here at the front counter now.

251
00:14:16,128 --> 00:14:17,540
Not what i would have done.

252
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:17,850
Really?

253
00:14:17,853 --> 00:14:19,560
Well, It's not an impulse buy.

254
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:21,640
And you have the tactics sets on the top shelves,

255
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:23,410
When everyone knows that historical wargamers

256
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:25,090
tend to be shorter than average.

257
00:14:25,094 --> 00:14:26,900
It's a wonder this place is still in business...

258
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,710
Oh, we are doing really well actually.

259
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:33,090
Business has improved, what? 200% since last november?

260
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:37,110
Say, wasn't that right around the time that Huey fired you,

261
00:14:37,112 --> 00:14:39,930
and made me assistant manager?

262
00:14:39,936 --> 00:14:43,580
That's weird right, Nathan?

263
00:14:43,586 --> 00:14:47,000
Scott leaves, business improves.

264
00:14:47,007 --> 00:14:48,400
Yeah, and Pokemon cards.

265
00:14:48,408 --> 00:14:50,770
And we're hosting games four nights a week now.

266
00:14:50,775 --> 00:14:54,620
All CRPG certified, and they are always packed.

267
00:14:54,622 --> 00:14:56,150
I prefer home games.

268
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,450
And guess who is coming to do a Q&A for us next month?

269
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,650
Pikachu?

270
00:15:05,998 --> 00:15:08,500
Greg Goran is coming here?

271
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,330
Just got this in today.

272
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:11,970
I thought you might want to be the first to know.

273
00:15:11,974 --> 00:15:13,810
How the fuck did you get Greg Goran?

274
00:15:13,811 --> 00:15:18,160
He's like... the godfather of tabletop gaming.

275
00:15:18,163 --> 00:15:20,390
That's really good.

276
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,670
Yeah, yeah we've got to put that on the flyer.

277
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,900
How much do i owe you?

278
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,650
$12,52.

279
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,570
Well worth the price.

280
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:33,400
Excuse me.

281
00:15:33,803 --> 00:15:38,300
What kind of games do you guys host here?

282
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:41,010
What are you looking for?

283
00:15:41,216 --> 00:15:44,810
Oh, i don't know, i used to play D&D back in high school.

284
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:48,610
Thought it would be fun to get back into it.

285
00:15:50,192 --> 00:15:51,491
Okay.

286
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:58,770
If you're looking for a game to play, i wouldn't play here if i where you.

287
00:15:58,772 --> 00:16:01,170
It's all pre-packaged by the numbers bullshit.

288
00:16:01,173 --> 00:16:04,450
Alright, I always prefer the homemade games to the published ones.

289
00:16:04,455 --> 00:16:08,150
Exactly! Now, the campaign i'm running is one epic story

290
00:16:08,157 --> 00:16:09,890
i've been writing for three years.

291
00:16:09,893 --> 00:16:13,310
And it's uh... Inspired.

292
00:16:13,317 --> 00:16:15,560
Right on, so it's D&D?

293
00:16:15,562 --> 00:16:17,530
No, it's not D&D.

294
00:16:17,531 --> 00:16:21,230
It's a fantasy rule system of my own design. I don't have a publisher yet

295
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:22,580
but it's in the works.

296
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:22,790
Oh.

297
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:24,770
Can i have my change, Please?

298
00:16:24,773 --> 00:16:27,410
Matter of fact, we have an opening for a new player.

299
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,470
If you are interested...

300
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:35,380
This is a very rare opportunity.

301
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:38,820
Sure, what the hell... i'm Miles.

302
00:16:38,828 --> 00:16:41,560
Scott, Scott Wiedemeyer. game master.

303
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,830
Oh my gosh, Martin you're not listening to me.

304
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:46,240
The Millennium Falcon is a broken down smuggler ship.

305
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,510
Yeah, but...

306
00:16:46,516 --> 00:16:47,590
No, no, no, no.

307
00:16:47,594 --> 00:16:49,570
The Enterprise is a federation starship.

308
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,450
Now, which do you think would be faster?

309
00:16:51,453 --> 00:16:53,180
That's exactly what i'm saying. The falcon

310
00:16:53,184 --> 00:16:54,900
isn't a warship like the Enterprise,

311
00:16:54,901 --> 00:16:56,640
and so it's only defense is speed.

312
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:58,450
Guys, you are never going to resolve this.

313
00:16:44,967 --> 00:17:01,370
No, no, no. Voyager, episode 31, aka. "Threshold".

314
00:17:01,374 --> 00:17:03,340
Oh, here we go with "Threshold" again.

315
00:17:03,349 --> 00:17:05,730
Everybody knows that episode is in canon.

316
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,180
Oh, for god's sake you guys!

317
00:16:44,967 --> 00:17:10,120
How many times do i have to tell you?

318
00:17:10,124 --> 00:17:11,830
There is no answer to this question.

319
00:17:11,835 --> 00:17:12,740
Let it go.

320
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:13,950
I'm just saying...

321
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:14,830
No, look,

322
00:17:14,836 --> 00:17:19,230
Everyone, let's try to keep the geekiness to a minimum tonight.

323
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:20,520
Okay?

324
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,620
Just be cool.

325
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:31,870
Hey Miles.

326
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:34,680
Scott.

327
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:38,200
No i... fuck it.

328
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:41,380
How about a hug?

329
00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:43,340
Falcon has what, one wookie and a...

330
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:45,570
Hey guy, this is Miles.

331
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,420
That's Martin, Leonard and Wayne.

332
00:17:48,423 --> 00:17:49,560
Hi.

333
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:50,890
What's up?

334
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:54,790
I brought a six-pack, if anyone wants one.

335
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:57,630
Is that cool?

336
00:17:57,636 --> 00:18:00,770
Uh, yeah, yeah, that' cool. Beer... Beer is cool.

337
00:18:00,773 --> 00:18:02,340
Did you want one?

338
00:18:02,342 --> 00:18:04,140
No, actually...

339
00:18:04,146 --> 00:18:07,240
I'm allergic to alcohol. It has an increased effect on me.

340
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:09,080
One is like ten.

341
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:10,480
Lucky you.

342
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:13,720
Well, If anyone else wants one, help yourself.

343
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:15,760
Should we ask him?

344
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,380
You ask him!

345
00:18:19,363 --> 00:18:21,330
Okay fine, i will ask him.

346
00:18:21,337 --> 00:18:23,900
Hey, Miles, which do you think is faster...

347
00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:26,010
The Enterprise or the Millennium Falcon?

348
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,360
Guys, we just went over this.

349
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,140
There is no answer to this question.

350
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,560
Actually, I'd have to say the Falcon.

351
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,760
— Common!
— I knew it!

352
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,820
No, listen, we are talking about two totally different technologies,

353
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:37,670
from different universes.

354
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:40,870
Now, check this out, the fastest Enterprise the Enterprise-D.

355
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:42,560
Has a max warp factor of what?

356
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,030
9.2

357
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:48,040
Which is 1,649 times the speed of light, we've been over this.

358
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,940
But there is no adequate conversion table

359
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:51,720
between warp factor and hyper drive.

360
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:56,770
But in Episode IV: A New Hope, the Millennium Falcon

361
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,260
travels from Tatooine, an outer rim system

362
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:03,300
to Alderaan, a core system

363
00:19:03,305 --> 00:19:05,480
in just a couple of days.

364
00:19:05,486 --> 00:19:08,460
Now, thats about half a diameter of a galaxy.

365
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:13,980
Even in a small galaxy, that's at least 5000 light years.

366
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:18,000
5.000 lightyears in just 2 days?

367
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,300
That's almost a million times the speed of light!

368
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:26,490
So, i'm going to say the Millennium Falcon is faster.

369
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,130
Fuck me!

370
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:32,780
We've been arguing about this forever. Even Scott couldn't figure this out!

371
00:19:32,787 --> 00:19:35,500
It's not that i couldn't figure it out.

372
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:38,890
I dont like wasting my time on hypotheticals.

373
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:42,710
I deal in reality, okay?

374
00:19:43,184 --> 00:19:46,250
Now can we roleplay please?

375
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:52,116
The four of you have just reached the entrance of the cave of Durakonor.

376
00:19:52,116 --> 00:19:56,140
Your dwarf guide tells you, he cannot let you proceed.

377
00:19:56,146 --> 00:19:58,070
This place is sacred.

378
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,870
I'll handle this.

379
00:20:00,877 --> 00:20:02,710
My good friend,

380
00:20:02,717 --> 00:20:06,590
I have lived in these mountains all my life.

381
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:12,610
I have as much of a right to enter the cave of Durakonor as any man.

382
00:20:15,495 --> 00:20:17,990
"You cannot fool me"!

383
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:20,260
"You are a tourist here".

384
00:20:20,267 --> 00:20:23,410
"You think you can come and go as you please".

385
00:20:23,412 --> 00:20:30,510
"But the natives of the Ungar mountains do not take kindly to interlopers".

386
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:34,950
Perhaps you are right.

387
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,360
But i am also powerfull.

388
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:41,890
You would be wise to not challenge me.

389
00:20:44,968 --> 00:20:46,670
Shit! Sorry.

390
00:20:46,673 --> 00:20:49,240
Uh, we usually turn off our cellphones before we start the game.

391
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,010
Text from my girlfriend.

392
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,440
She wants me to come home.

393
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:54,540
I know what she wants.

394
00:20:54,548 --> 00:20:57,080
Oh lord, that's nasty!

395
00:20:57,087 --> 00:21:01,510
Not to be too crude but I've never been with a chick who needed it so much.

396
00:21:01,516 --> 00:21:04,120
I mean don't get me wrong, she's absolutly beautiful.

397
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:09,400
But i'm always exhausted. You know what i mean?

398
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:12,830
Oh, yeah.

399
00:21:26,762 --> 00:21:29,590
Miles was pretty funny tonight, huh Scott?

400
00:21:29,596 --> 00:21:31,430
Yeah, i guess.

401
00:21:31,435 --> 00:21:37,030
The way he told that captain of the guard to suck his stubby dwarf dick...

402
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:39,410
And his backstory was hilarious!

403
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,010
When he said he was raised by wherepigs,

404
00:21:41,012 --> 00:21:44,890
so he had to squeal like a pig everytime he goes into battle...

405
00:21:44,899 --> 00:21:48,163
Wayne, please!

406
00:21:48,163 --> 00:21:51,260
RPG is about more then just being funny you know..

407
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,230
I mean, if all i wanted to do was crack you guys up for three hours,

408
00:21:54,232 --> 00:21:57,740
i could do that you know, that's easy.

409
00:21:57,746 --> 00:22:00,310
What's hard is to get people to think.

410
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,540
To get them emotionally invested in the story.

411
00:22:03,546 --> 00:22:06,650
That's hard, right?

412
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,650
Right?

413
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,630
Right, Wayne?

414
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,200
Wayne!

415
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,520
Uh? What?

416
00:22:12,524 --> 00:22:13,700
What are you doing?

417
00:22:13,702 --> 00:22:16,500
Nothing.

418
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,280
Is that that girl? What's her name?

419
00:22:22,281 --> 00:22:23,460
Beth.

420
00:22:23,462 --> 00:22:24,570
Is that her?

421
00:22:24,574 --> 00:22:27,090
What do you think?

422
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,720
Seems nice.

423
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,920
I'm thinking i might ask her out this weekend.

424
00:22:38,862 --> 00:22:40,090
What?

425
00:22:40,096 --> 00:22:42,560
You really think that's a good idea?

426
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:43,930
What do you mean?

427
00:22:43,934 --> 00:22:47,300
Well, these online relationships can be tricky.

428
00:22:47,306 --> 00:22:53,290
She's probably built an image in her mind, of some tall, handsome and charming guy

429
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:55,880
And when she meets you, well...

430
00:22:55,884 --> 00:22:59,080
You know.

431
00:23:00,324 --> 00:23:03,200
Oh my god, Wayne you have a huge zit on your face.

432
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,230
I know.

433
00:23:04,238 --> 00:23:05,250
Let me get it for you.

434
00:23:05,253 --> 00:23:06,260
No!

435
00:23:06,263 --> 00:23:07,110
Come on, it's ready.

436
00:23:07,112 --> 00:23:08,060
No, it will scar!

437
00:23:08,063 --> 00:23:09,930
No, i don't want you to.

438
00:23:09,934 --> 00:23:11,400
Get down!

439
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,020
No Scott. Come on get off me!

440
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,200
Come on, i'm not going to let you walk around with that on your face!

441
00:23:15,205 --> 00:23:19,100
Come on Scott! Wait, wait... my glasses.

442
00:23:24,527 --> 00:23:28,120
Oh god.

443
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:41,670
Want to sleep over?

444
00:23:47,256 --> 00:23:50,240
Hey, Wayne.

445
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,160
Wayne.

446
00:23:53,896 --> 00:23:55,140
Hey.

447
00:23:55,144 --> 00:23:56,380
Yeah?

448
00:23:56,388 --> 00:23:58,570
Remember when the tender of Nerndor

449
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:02,140
put that curse of never ending flatulence on Martin's cleric?

450
00:24:02,142 --> 00:24:06,380
And his farting gave away your position to the kobolds?

451
00:24:06,386 --> 00:24:09,230
That was pretty funny, right?

452
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:12,780
Yeah, i guess.

453
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:17,500
I come up with funny stuff all the time. What's the big deal?

454
00:24:17,506 --> 00:24:19,030
— Scott!

455
00:24:19,036 --> 00:24:22,530
Okay! Wayne, try and keep it down, alright?

456
00:24:22,537 --> 00:24:24,450
— Scott!

457
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,470
Okay!

458
00:24:29,075 --> 00:24:32,070
What was that?

459
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,130
Hello.

460
00:24:48,138 --> 00:24:49,970
Hey Barbara, it's Scott.

461
00:24:49,976 --> 00:24:51,570
Scottie, how are you?

462
00:24:51,576 --> 00:24:54,150
I'm fine. Look, Nana had a stroke.

463
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,810
Oh my god, is she dead?

464
00:24:55,817 --> 00:24:58,250
No, she's alive.

465
00:24:58,252 --> 00:25:00,650
No, no you don't need to come here.

466
00:25:00,656 --> 00:25:04,390
I think she just wants you to call her.

467
00:25:04,393 --> 00:25:06,630
No, that's not necessary.

468
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,240
Why not? It will just be for a couple of weeks.

469
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,830
Because then i would have to clean the shit out of the guest room.

470
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,600
— Scott! You can be so selfish!
— I'm not being selfish.

471
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,910
She's my mother, and i'm coming to see here whether you like it or not.

472
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:17,840
Fine!

473
00:25:17,844 --> 00:25:20,290
And it will be great to see you.

474
00:25:20,293 --> 00:25:23,490
Whatever. I've got to go.

475
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:26,750
I see you didn't mow the lawn.

476
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:29,270
I was gonna.

477
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:29,960
Ah!

478
00:25:29,964 --> 00:25:30,270
Ah! Shit.

479
00:25:30,276 --> 00:25:32,380
Scott, for Christ's sake!

480
00:25:32,389 --> 00:25:33,670
Are you trying to kill me?

481
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,840
Sorry, Nana. I'm trying.

482
00:25:34,842 --> 00:25:37,310
I just got out of the hospital.

483
00:26:16,163 --> 00:26:19,630
You wish.

484
00:26:20,434 --> 00:26:22,150
We're here!

485
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:22,440
Shit!

486
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:26,050
Anyone home?

487
00:26:30,615 --> 00:26:33,630
Scottie! There you are.

488
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,380
Hi.

489
00:26:35,388 --> 00:26:40,140
Come here and give your mom a hug!

490
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:42,960
Come on.

491
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:51,250
Scottie, this is Bob.

492
00:26:51,253 --> 00:26:53,040
Hi buddy. It's so good to meet you.

493
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:55,610
Your mom has told me a whole lot about you.

494
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,780
Like what?

495
00:26:57,786 --> 00:27:00,020
Well... uh...

496
00:27:00,023 --> 00:27:02,520
Well, you're here son and uh...

497
00:27:02,526 --> 00:27:05,120
Uh... you.

498
00:27:05,128 --> 00:27:09,620
Scottie, Why don't you help Bob with the bags?

499
00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:15,960
My god.

500
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,250
This house looks exactly the same.

501
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:23,780
Have you two been stuck in a time warp?

502
00:27:29,162 --> 00:27:30,530
Nana!

503
00:27:30,531 --> 00:27:32,230
Barbara is home.

504
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:37,260
Hello mom, it's me! Barbara!

505
00:27:37,266 --> 00:27:38,670
Jesus!

506
00:27:38,678 --> 00:27:41,110
Why are you yelling at me?

507
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,480
I know who the hell you are.

508
00:27:43,485 --> 00:27:48,180
It's good to see you. You look fantastic.

509
00:27:48,957 --> 00:27:52,060
Pillow.

510
00:27:52,066 --> 00:27:53,760
Mom.

511
00:27:53,762 --> 00:27:55,360
This is Bob.

512
00:27:55,364 --> 00:27:58,360
Ma'am.

513
00:27:59,871 --> 00:28:03,320
Here, let me do that right.

514
00:28:03,323 --> 00:28:06,940
Bob and i met at a self-help seminar

515
00:28:06,949 --> 00:28:09,150
in Dallas, last month, and

516
00:28:09,152 --> 00:28:13,320
we hit it off immediately, and...

517
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,520
drum roll!

518
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:18,200
We are getting married.

519
00:28:18,209 --> 00:28:21,260
Third time's the charm.

520
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:23,430
Harvey doesn't count mother. It was annulled.

521
00:28:23,438 --> 00:28:25,900
You know she was part of a sex cult, right?

522
00:28:25,907 --> 00:28:27,270
Mother!

523
00:28:27,277 --> 00:28:29,480
First of all, that was ages ago.

524
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,580
And secondly, it was an agricultural commune.

525
00:28:32,581 --> 00:28:35,310
Yeah, right.

526
00:28:35,317 --> 00:28:38,290
You think i don't know what goes on in those places.

527
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,320
Look mom, i know, i was kind of wild as a kid

528
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,430
— maybe a little irresponsible...
— As a kid?

529
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:45,670
But things are different now.

530
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:50,600
I'm getting married, and by next fall i'll be a registered nurse.

531
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:53,890
You? A nurse?

532
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:58,110
Remind me never to have a stroke in Arizona.

533
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,990
I came here to help you.

534
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:06,200
You know, To take care of you while you get back on your feet

535
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,630
and to get this house in order.

536
00:29:08,634 --> 00:29:10,430
There is nothing wrong with this house.

537
00:29:10,435 --> 00:29:12,160
Boy, If i knew all i had to do

538
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,030
to get a visit from my daughter was

539
00:29:14,036 --> 00:29:19,130
pop a blood vessel in my brain, i would have done it years ago.

540
00:29:20,987 --> 00:29:23,550
You see what i've had to deal with.

541
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:26,190
Don't bother trying to do anything nice in this family.

542
00:29:26,191 --> 00:29:27,690
Oh, for Christ sake...

543
00:29:27,694 --> 00:29:29,790
You wonder why i don't visit more often.

544
00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:31,240
Maybe its because i'm made to feel

545
00:29:31,243 --> 00:29:33,160
totally unwelcome everytime i come here.

546
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:36,070
Calm down Barbara. Nobody is out to get you.

547
00:29:36,072 --> 00:29:38,770
I was going to cook a nice dinner tonight, but...

548
00:29:38,775 --> 00:29:42,370
Now i feel a migraine coming on.

549
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:45,880
That's just great! I'll probably be late up all evening.

550
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:49,420
Bob, could you get me the coco syrup and a hot towel?

551
00:29:49,424 --> 00:29:52,520
Sure babe.

552
00:29:55,602 --> 00:29:59,370
Well, it was a long flight.

553
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:02,700
I bet.

554
00:30:12,557 --> 00:30:15,960
Ulrich Benevon, son of Valrich,

555
00:30:15,961 --> 00:30:20,460
Keeper of the stones of light,

556
00:30:24,205 --> 00:30:29,350
meets his mortal enemy on the battlefield,

557
00:30:29,352 --> 00:30:33,680
the goblin queen Morgan.

558
00:30:41,164 --> 00:30:47,460
You will pay for your betrayal Morgan, with blood!

559
00:30:47,905 --> 00:30:51,990
Oh, Ulrich. Forever the hero.

560
00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:56,450
But all your posturing will not safe the life of your king!

561
00:30:56,453 --> 00:31:02,150
Or bring your family back from the grave.

562
00:31:05,229 --> 00:31:08,930
I swear this...

563
00:31:08,936 --> 00:31:14,260
My family's blood, shall be avenged.

564
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:19,910
The god's demand retribution!

565
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,910
Knock!

566
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:31,390
Sorry, i thought this was a bathroom.

567
00:31:31,395 --> 00:31:34,690
Goddamnit!

568
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:37,920
What?

569
00:31:37,928 --> 00:31:39,470
Hey.

570
00:31:39,476 --> 00:31:43,150
I just wanted to thank you for getting the room ready for us.

571
00:31:43,157 --> 00:31:46,420
Yeah, fine.

572
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:51,849
So, you into wizzards and shit?

573
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:53,890
I guess.

574
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,830
I saw those Lords of the ring movies.

575
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,900
They were pretty cool.

576
00:31:58,904 --> 00:32:04,600
Not so sure about those hobbits though, you know what i mean.

577
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:09,860
You a cowboys fan?

578
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:12,020
What do you mean, like westerns?

579
00:32:12,021 --> 00:32:15,090
No, like Dallas.

580
00:32:15,093 --> 00:32:17,890
Oh, football. No.

581
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:21,560
It's hard to believe they let two back's run up over a hundered yards against  them

582
00:32:21,569 --> 00:32:25,670
when all last season it didnt happen 25% all of the games played...

583
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:28,860
Yeah well, I'm going to bed now, so...

584
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,700
Right, sure. Well, have a good evening.

585
00:32:31,706 --> 00:32:35,010
Close the door.

586
00:32:40,063 --> 00:32:43,360
What the fuck is this?

587
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,240
Shit!

588
00:32:56,149 --> 00:32:58,860
Mom! Mom!

589
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,830
Barbara!

590
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,250
What the hell is going on in there?

591
00:33:03,257 --> 00:33:05,320
Well goodmorning to you too.

592
00:33:05,329 --> 00:33:07,130
What is Bob doing in the hallway?

593
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:10,430
I asked him to take a look at the wiring. He's a contractor, he knows what he's doing.

594
00:33:10,437 --> 00:33:11,730
The wiring is fine.

595
00:33:11,738 --> 00:33:13,510
How would you know that?

596
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,610
Because the lights go on when you flip the switches.

597
00:33:16,611 --> 00:33:20,320
Old wiring can cause fires.

598
00:33:20,326 --> 00:33:24,920
No one is keeping an eye on this place. Look at all this clutter.

599
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,820
It isn't safe for Nana.

600
00:33:26,826 --> 00:33:28,430
Hey, be careful with that, it's mine.

601
00:33:28,431 --> 00:33:31,490
Well, get it out of the living room, then!

602
00:33:31,497 --> 00:33:35,090
Just so you know, tonight is game night, so i'll need the house to myself.

603
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:38,140
God, are you still playing your little dragons game?

604
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:39,840
Yes.

605
00:33:39,844 --> 00:33:43,240
So you and Bob need to stay in your room or go out for the night.

606
00:33:43,245 --> 00:33:48,260
Really? Your mother comes all the way from Arizona and you want her to go out?

607
00:33:48,266 --> 00:33:49,990
Or stay in your room.

608
00:33:49,991 --> 00:33:53,260
Don't you think you should postpone your little game while we are in town?

609
00:33:53,263 --> 00:33:56,260
No mom, this is important to me! We never cancel game night!

610
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:59,200
Okay, Okay!

611
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:02,660
God, you sound just like you did when you were ten.

612
00:34:02,663 --> 00:34:07,370
It was that tone of voice that made it easy for me to leave, you know?

613
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:16,950
Let's rock and roll!

614
00:34:18,502 --> 00:34:20,910
Oh my god!

615
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:23,020
That was fucking rad!

616
00:34:23,026 --> 00:34:24,270
Nice work.

617
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:25,010
You like it?

618
00:34:25,017 --> 00:34:26,660
It's fun, but uh

619
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:29,870
it captures a sense of isolation and dread.

620
00:34:29,877 --> 00:34:30,420
Exactly.

621
00:34:30,425 --> 00:34:33,530
What the subtext clear? About the dangers of meddling with nature?

622
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,890
— Oh, for sure.
— Nice!

623
00:34:34,894 --> 00:34:37,740
You know i could put a link to this on my website if you want.

624
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,350
Maybe drive up some traffic.

625
00:34:39,352 --> 00:34:40,330
What's your website?

626
00:34:40,334 --> 00:34:43,140
It's a pop culture news source.

627
00:34:43,146 --> 00:34:48,410
We do articles on comics and games, movies, that sort of thing.

628
00:34:48,412 --> 00:34:52,948
It's GeekChic.com.

629
00:34:52,948 --> 00:34:55,360
You work for GeekChic?

630
00:34:55,366 --> 00:34:57,440
I'm a founding editor.

631
00:34:57,446 --> 00:34:59,950
No way! I go there all the time.

632
00:34:59,959 --> 00:35:02,900
Me too! Just yesterday i was reading the article about the top 100 comic book villains.

633
00:35:04,918 --> 00:35:05,770
It was awesome!

634
00:35:05,779 --> 00:35:06,040
Thanks.

635
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:08,650
And you would put Blood Brigade on Geekchic?

636
00:35:08,652 --> 00:35:09,700
Oh, for sure

637
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,500
Oh my god, that's awesome.

638
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,000
I've got a blog too.

639
00:35:13,003 --> 00:35:17,640
Mostly game related, but i write about movies and other stuff.

640
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:19,190
Cool!

641
00:35:19,197 --> 00:35:21,640
Yeah, but that's different Scott.

642
00:35:21,644 --> 00:35:25,450
Not really. We both write articles for the internet . Is what i'm saying.

643
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:30,050
Well yeah but Geekshic is a real website with adds and everything.

644
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:34,130
Oh, just cause i'm not trying to make a buck it's not real?

645
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,460
Well, no. I mean, your webs...

646
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:38,380
Some would say it's more noble.

647
00:35:38,385 --> 00:35:41,460
Well yeah, but Miles has thousands of readers.

648
00:35:41,468 --> 00:35:41,740
Millions.

649
00:35:41,747 --> 00:35:44,250
Millions of readers. Nobody reads your blog.

650
00:35:44,259 --> 00:35:46,370
What the fuck are you talking about?

651
00:35:46,373 --> 00:35:50,440
Fourteen visitors a week is nobody?

652
00:35:50,441 --> 00:35:53,340
Scott, you guys are being way too loud.

653
00:35:53,345 --> 00:35:54,790
Yeah, fine.

654
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:58,970
No. Not fine. I need you to call it a night, like now.

655
00:35:58,972 --> 00:36:01,930
We haven't even started yet.

656
00:36:01,932 --> 00:36:06,660
Scott, be a grownup about this. Your grandmother had a stroke last week.

657
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:08,780
Yeah, last week.

658
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:14,480
I'm serious, Scott. Say goodnight to your friends.

659
00:36:16,529 --> 00:36:18,700
We could play at my house, if you want.

660
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:19,380
No.

661
00:36:19,388 --> 00:36:22,000
This isn't Barbara's house.

662
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:26,500
And Barbara can stay at a motel if she doesn't like it.

663
00:36:35,355 --> 00:36:37,570
What are you doing?

664
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:42,060
Well, as long as you're going to keep me up, i may as well join the game.

665
00:36:42,064 --> 00:36:43,290
You can't do that!

666
00:36:43,298 --> 00:36:49,440
Let's see, i'll call my character Princess Razzmatazz.

667
00:36:49,442 --> 00:36:51,410
I said you can't do that.

668
00:36:51,411 --> 00:36:53,810
Race, caucasian.

669
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:57,260
Sex, yes please.

670
00:36:57,263 --> 00:37:01,930
And she'll look just like Wonderwoman.

671
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:05,610
You like Wonderwoman don't you Scott?

672
00:37:05,613 --> 00:37:07,310
No.

673
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,680
That's not what i heard.

674
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,280
Did Scott ever tell you why he was suspended in 8th grade?

675
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,680
What are you talking about? I was never suspended.

676
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,850
It has to do with the boy's bathroom

677
00:37:18,859 --> 00:37:23,080
and a Wonderwoman comic book.

678
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,040
That is bullshit!

679
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,090
I was cleaning a stain of my pants

680
00:37:28,095 --> 00:37:31,190
And Billy Mizer told everyone a lie because he hated me.

681
00:37:31,196 --> 00:37:33,560
That's not what the school psychologist said.

682
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:36,640
Guys, she's full of shit. She was in Colorado when it happend.

683
00:37:36,641 --> 00:37:38,670
I mean, didn't happen!

684
00:37:38,672 --> 00:37:41,710
Your grandmother told me all about it.

685
00:37:41,712 --> 00:37:43,880
She said you had to change schools

686
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,380
because all the other kids kept calling you the Super Stroker.

687
00:37:52,227 --> 00:37:57,220
Oh, and then there was the whole shampoo bottle incident.

688
00:37:58,368 --> 00:38:00,430
Oh my god!

689
00:38:00,439 --> 00:38:05,330
Fuck it! I don't wanna play anymore i'm tired anyways.

690
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:11,350
Thank you.

691
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:20,590
Yeah well, at least i didn't abandon my son to grow marijuana in Mexico!

692
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:49,710
Hello?

693
00:40:05,978 --> 00:40:09,170
Oh, fuck!

694
00:40:24,105 --> 00:40:27,300
Fucking bullsh...

695
00:41:27,227 --> 00:41:31,020
Well met, adventurer!

696
00:41:33,569 --> 00:41:36,170
You're here for the game, right?

697
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,240
Yeah.

698
00:41:37,241 --> 00:41:41,760
Oh my god, good. I'm Kendra, Miles's girlfriend.

699
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:44,070
You're Scott, right?

700
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,480
How did you know that?

701
00:41:45,482 --> 00:41:49,480
Cause everyone else is here, come on in.

702
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,440
These are amazing.

703
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,150
You are super talented.

704
00:41:55,156 --> 00:41:56,360
Hey Scott, have a seat.

705
00:41:56,367 --> 00:42:00,160
Scott, can i get you anything to drink? A beer or wine?

706
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:02,740
Do you have any diet

707
00:42:02,745 --> 00:42:04,910
No, sorry.

708
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,640
Just water then.

709
00:42:06,647 --> 00:42:08,510
Water.

710
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:13,320
I was just showing the guys a couple of the pages from the comic book that i'm working on.

711
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:15,490
Check it out.

712
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,760
So, did you go to art school or something?

713
00:42:17,763 --> 00:42:21,460
No. I'm pretty much just self taught.

714
00:42:23,104 --> 00:42:24,440
Nice.

715
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:25,590
Thank you.

716
00:42:25,597 --> 00:42:29,690
It's uh... pretty nerdy obsession. I don't know how Kendra puts up with it.

717
00:42:29,698 --> 00:42:33,765
Oh, please, you know i think nerds are sexy.

718
00:42:33,765 --> 00:42:37,380
His brush work reminds me of early Tom Palmer.

719
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,390
Love Tom Palmer. Check this out.

720
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:45,490
This crosshatch right here? I basically just copied his new...

721
00:42:46,069 --> 00:42:49,300
So, you're the game master huh?

722
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,030
Yeah.

723
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:56,600
I guess that means you're pretty creative, right?

724
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,710
I guess.

725
00:43:01,591 --> 00:43:03,550
Can i see your hands?

726
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:05,220
Why?

727
00:43:05,228 --> 00:43:08,720
I'm taking this course in hand analysis, you know like um

728
00:43:08,728 --> 00:43:12,900
when you can tell about someones personality based on the shape of their hands.

729
00:43:12,905 --> 00:43:15,900
Let me see.

730
00:43:16,846 --> 00:43:19,940
I'm not gonna bite.

731
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:31,890
I'm just kidding, relax. Let me see.

732
00:43:35,336 --> 00:43:38,030
Okay...

733
00:43:41,445 --> 00:43:44,360
Okay.

734
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,300
So...

735
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:51,420
See? Your index finger is the same length as your ring finger,

736
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:56,320
which means that you are very sensitive.

737
00:43:57,335 --> 00:43:59,140
And... Oh!

738
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:03,060
Yeah, the thumb angle on your right hand is greater than that of your left

739
00:44:03,069 --> 00:44:06,370
which means you're a romantic at heart.

740
00:44:06,378 --> 00:44:09,480
Is that true?

741
00:44:10,252 --> 00:44:11,840
Yeah.

742
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,200
Scott, Do you hear this?

743
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,240
What?

744
00:44:14,245 --> 00:44:16,520
Miles might get his comic book published.

745
00:44:16,522 --> 00:44:19,760
Not exactly. I'm in talks with a publisher.

746
00:44:19,762 --> 00:44:22,840
I can't tell you which one, but you would know the name.

747
00:44:22,841 --> 00:44:26,220
Oh, that's really exciting. Congratulations.

748
00:44:26,224 --> 00:44:29,410
Well, i hope you're protecting yourself.

749
00:44:29,419 --> 00:44:30,780
What do you mean?

750
00:44:30,783 --> 00:44:33,430
Trust me. I've had first hand experience

751
00:44:33,431 --> 00:44:37,030
with how these big companies treat their writers.

752
00:44:37,032 --> 00:44:38,070
Oh yeah?

753
00:44:38,077 --> 00:44:41,190
I don't wanna dig up the past, but short version...

754
00:44:41,192 --> 00:44:42,500
You know the Matrix?

755
00:44:42,506 --> 00:44:44,320
Scott, shouldn't we get the game started?

756
00:44:44,323 --> 00:44:46,530
You mean the film with Keanu Reeves?

757
00:44:46,533 --> 00:44:48,700
You know who wrote that?

758
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,520
The Wachowski's?

759
00:44:51,526 --> 00:44:53,050
Tell him Wayne.

760
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:53,960
Scott.

761
00:44:53,966 --> 00:44:55,140
Tell him.

762
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,760
Scott wrote a story like The Matrix.

763
00:44:57,764 --> 00:45:00,080
I didn't write a story like The Matrix.

764
00:45:00,089 --> 00:45:04,280
I wrote The Matrix.

765
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,800
It was 1998. I was fourteen.

766
00:45:13,805 --> 00:45:18,450
I saw an add for a short story contest in Digital Horizons magazine.

767
00:45:18,453 --> 00:45:22,700
I had a short science fiction story i had been working on since junion high.

768
00:45:22,706 --> 00:45:26,350
Naturally i submitted it. When i didn't hear anything back, i thought,

769
00:45:26,353 --> 00:45:27,520
"Whatever".

770
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,080
"Their loss".

771
00:45:29,086 --> 00:45:35,826
But it must have caught someone's attention. Because guess what comes out one year later?

772
00:45:35,826 --> 00:45:38,020
What?

773
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,920
The Matrix.

774
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,410
Can you imagine sitting in the theater,

775
00:45:43,415 --> 00:45:46,690
watching as your story unfolds on the big screen?

776
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:49,390
And audiences are loving it.

777
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:53,020
But no one know it's your idea.

778
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:57,610
So it was your story exactly, same characters and everything?

779
00:45:57,618 --> 00:45:58,140
No.

780
00:45:58,146 --> 00:46:00,550
No, they made some superficial changes,

781
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:03,500
Character names, some plot points, the title. But the core concept...

782
00:46:03,507 --> 00:46:06,400
What was your title?

783
00:46:06,409 --> 00:46:10,110
Knights of circuitry.

784
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:18,690
Well, that's a little strange.

785
00:46:18,698 --> 00:46:20,790
Not as strange as you would think, unfortunately.

786
00:46:20,799 --> 00:46:23,700
No, i mean, for starters

787
00:46:23,705 --> 00:46:28,200
One year is a pretty quick turn around time for a film of that scale.

788
00:46:31,915 --> 00:46:34,090
Could have been two.

789
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:36,880
I think the Wachowski's were actually shopping that script around

790
00:46:36,887 --> 00:46:38,460
for a while before it got picked up.

791
00:46:38,469 --> 00:46:38,840
Miles.

792
00:46:38,849 --> 00:46:39,920
That's not to say that...

793
00:46:39,925 --> 00:46:41,400
And let's be honest.

794
00:46:41,402 --> 00:46:43,840
There are plenty of known influences on their work,

795
00:46:43,847 --> 00:46:48,940
from William Gibson to Jean Baudrillard to Mamoru Oshii.

796
00:46:48,947 --> 00:46:51,150
I think even Doctor Who had a similar

797
00:46:51,158 --> 00:46:54,670
storyline in the 70's, so...

798
00:46:56,263 --> 00:46:59,240
You believe everything you read on Wikipedia?

799
00:46:59,246 --> 00:47:01,880
Actually, they told me themselves, on their set one time.

800
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,480
Really?

801
00:47:03,484 --> 00:47:06,240
Yeah. They were really cool.

802
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:07,420
That's so cool!

803
00:47:07,421 --> 00:47:07,960
I know.

804
00:47:07,967 --> 00:47:11,410
Well, of course they are not gonna admit it.

805
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:14,870
— You obviously have no idea how Hollywood works.
— Scott.

806
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:18,010
That's the problem with film journalism right there.

807
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:20,340
These so called film critics

808
00:47:20,347 --> 00:47:23,240
who just want to be buddy buddy with the big shots,

809
00:47:23,249 --> 00:47:29,150
and they forget about the real artists, who are getting stepped on.

810
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,940
But, good luck with your comic.

811
00:47:43,514 --> 00:47:47,310
Don't say i didn't warn you.

812
00:47:49,055 --> 00:47:51,950
Thanks.

813
00:48:53,345 --> 00:48:56,230
Scott!

814
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:59,240
Are you okay?

815
00:49:04,726 --> 00:49:08,220
Yeah.

816
00:49:12,638 --> 00:49:14,260
Right.

817
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:18,620
The four of you have just reached the temple of Azakari,

818
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:23,440
but a figure stands in your way.

819
00:49:23,449 --> 00:49:27,020
I am Ulrich Benevon, son of Valrich,

820
00:49:27,025 --> 00:49:30,150
keeper of the stones of light.

821
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:32,830
Before i grant you these stones however,

822
00:49:32,832 --> 00:49:35,630
you must prove yourselves worthy.

823
00:49:35,635 --> 00:49:37,200
How?

824
00:49:37,206 --> 00:49:40,270
Far to the north, there is a mountain

825
00:49:40,275 --> 00:49:42,640
in which dwells a powerful wizzard.

826
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:45,340
In the wizzard's study is a chest...

827
00:49:45,348 --> 00:49:49,730
where he keeps a single feather, from an ancient Phoenix

828
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:51,000
Which is the source of...

829
00:49:51,001 --> 00:49:52,040
Fuck this.

830
00:49:52,047 --> 00:49:55,910
Let's kill the guy and take the stones.

831
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,050
You can't do that, he's a good guy.

832
00:49:58,057 --> 00:50:01,780
He's a dick. I'm gonna throw my sword at his head.

833
00:50:01,784 --> 00:50:04,190
But that's not what you're supposed to do.

834
00:50:04,191 --> 00:50:06,420
What do you mean "supposed to do"?

835
00:50:06,422 --> 00:50:09,310
Thought we could do whatever we wanted right.

836
00:50:09,316 --> 00:50:10,380
Well, yeah, but...

837
00:50:10,387 --> 00:50:14,980
Or are you the only one that gets to make any real decisions?

838
00:50:21,933 --> 00:50:23,200
Fine!

839
00:50:23,201 --> 00:50:25,150
But you'll need a 20 to hit.

840
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:28,250
I'm feeling lucky.

841
00:50:28,743 --> 00:50:33,040
20! Oh shit!

842
00:50:34,038 --> 00:50:35,520
Give me a break.

843
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,090
And 20 is a mortal blow, right?

844
00:50:37,098 --> 00:50:40,280
He has to do a stamina check, or he's dead, right?

845
00:50:40,281 --> 00:50:42,060
Are you fucking serious?

846
00:50:42,061 --> 00:50:46,560
I didn't make the rules man. You did, remember?

847
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:51,700
This is so stupid.

848
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:55,500
14.

849
00:50:56,916 --> 00:50:58,250
Shit!

850
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:01,120
Now it's my turn and you're about to get fucked.

851
00:51:01,122 --> 00:51:02,840
That's a 4.

852
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,420
What?

853
00:51:04,424 --> 00:51:07,160
That wasn't a 14. That was a 4.

854
00:51:07,161 --> 00:51:08,990
No, it was a 14.

855
00:51:08,996 --> 00:51:12,200
Oh my god. You are lying. Why are you lying?

856
00:51:12,204 --> 00:51:15,140
I'm not lying. You don't even know how to play.

857
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:17,240
I know cheating when i see it.

858
00:51:17,244 --> 00:51:19,710
I can't cheat. I'm the game master.

859
00:51:19,715 --> 00:51:21,750
Yeah, that's what Nixon said.

860
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,260
Maybe we should reroll.

861
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,370
Scott, what was it?

862
00:51:24,377 --> 00:51:27,170
Was it a 4?

863
00:51:32,999 --> 00:51:35,200
So what if it was?

864
00:51:35,207 --> 00:51:37,630
I'm the game master, and it's my job to make sure

865
00:51:37,638 --> 00:51:40,180
the game runs smoothly,

866
00:51:40,182 --> 00:51:42,680
even when people intentionally try to mess it up.

867
00:51:42,686 --> 00:51:46,230
I'm not trying to mess anything up. I'm just trying to have a good time.

868
00:51:46,235 --> 00:51:49,110
Don't give me that innocent shit!

869
00:51:49,115 --> 00:51:53,110
You may have these guys fooled, but i can see right through you.

870
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:54,740
What's that supposed to mean?

871
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:57,080
You like to be the big fish, don't you?

872
00:51:57,088 --> 00:51:58,860
Come hang out with all the losers,

873
00:51:58,868 --> 00:52:01,570
so you are the coolest guy in the room, right?

874
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:03,540
Look, if you think you and your friends

875
00:52:03,541 --> 00:52:05,710
are losers that's your problem, not mine.

876
00:52:05,711 --> 00:52:07,680
He's putting words in my mouth.

877
00:52:07,681 --> 00:52:10,380
You can't trust him guys, he's not your friend.

878
00:52:10,387 --> 00:52:11,650
He's more of a friend then you are, Scott.

879
00:52:11,653 --> 00:52:13,640
Miles put Blood Brigade on his website, and we got

880
00:52:13,641 --> 00:52:15,450
almost 400.000 hits from that.

881
00:52:15,454 --> 00:52:17,340
Yeah, we asked you like a hundered times

882
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:19,100
to put it on your blog and you never did.

883
00:52:19,109 --> 00:52:20,920
Not that anyone reads it anyway.

884
00:52:20,922 --> 00:52:26,519
Wake up guys, he only did that so people could laught at it.

885
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:28,310
That's not true.

886
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:30,550
What? Why would anybody laugh at it?

887
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:32,280
Because it's aweful.

888
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,480
Scott.

889
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,510
And i'm only saying this because im your friend.

890
00:52:35,518 --> 00:52:36,980
And i don't like to see you made fun of.

891
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,810
I think it's good.

892
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:42,790
Please, you really think Blood Brigade is a good piece of entertainment?

893
00:52:42,795 --> 00:52:43,870
I do.

894
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:44,650
Really?

895
00:52:44,653 --> 00:52:46,460
I do. I genuinely like it.

896
00:52:46,467 --> 00:52:47,580
He's full of shit.

897
00:52:47,582 --> 00:52:49,510
Okay, i think you need to leave Scott.

898
00:52:49,512 --> 00:52:53,060
Damn right i am. We all are, come on guys.

899
00:52:55,946 --> 00:52:57,360
I'm staying here.

900
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,980
Me too.

901
00:53:01,086 --> 00:53:03,120
Guys!

902
00:53:03,123 --> 00:53:06,560
I'm the game master. I'm the game.

903
00:53:06,566 --> 00:53:10,490
Well, we don't want to play your game anymore.

904
00:53:11,736 --> 00:53:13,640
What?

905
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,810
After all we've been through,

906
00:53:16,813 --> 00:53:19,220
you're gonna abandon my game.

907
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:21,230
Our game.

908
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:24,140
For him?

909
00:53:29,594 --> 00:53:32,630
You can't do this to me. I've put too much work into this...

910
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:35,860
It's not supposed to be work Scott.

911
00:53:35,868 --> 00:53:39,212
It's supposed to be fun.

912
00:53:39,212 --> 00:53:44,340
Yeah, Scott. The game has gotten too serious. It's not fun anymore.

913
00:53:46,182 --> 00:53:49,216
I can't believe this.

914
00:53:49,216 --> 00:53:51,850
Well you cant keep your character sheets, they're mine.

915
00:53:51,857 --> 00:53:53,750
Give it to me!

916
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:57,120
Fuck it. I don't want it anyways. Come on Wayne.

917
00:53:57,123 --> 00:53:58,780
Let's go.

918
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,630
Wait Scott, can't we work this out?

919
00:54:00,636 --> 00:54:03,930
Wayne, come!

920
00:54:08,548 --> 00:54:11,640
Do whatever you want man.

921
00:54:29,076 --> 00:54:32,170
I'm sorry Scott.

922
00:54:43,665 --> 00:54:46,760
Okay, fine.

923
00:54:49,372 --> 00:54:52,080
Just know,

924
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,110
when this guy gets done with this little expirement,

925
00:54:55,111 --> 00:54:58,040
and cuts you loose,

926
00:54:58,046 --> 00:55:01,850
don't bother trying to come back.

927
00:55:03,357 --> 00:55:06,760
So, come with me now,

928
00:55:06,766 --> 00:55:10,290
and all is forgotten.

929
00:55:17,244 --> 00:55:22,040
And everyone gets 500 experience points.

930
00:55:29,293 --> 00:55:32,490
Fuck you then.

931
00:55:43,983 --> 00:55:46,110
Ulrich Benovon,

932
00:55:46,112 --> 00:55:48,080
Son of Valrich,

933
00:55:48,086 --> 00:55:50,960
keeper of the stones of light,

934
00:55:50,969 --> 00:55:54,733
encounters his new enemy.

935
00:55:54,733 --> 00:55:57,520
Miles Butler.

936
00:55:57,523 --> 00:56:01,570
Hey, i'm Miles. I'm the coolest.

937
00:56:01,573 --> 00:56:03,580
My website gets a 100.000 views...

938
00:56:03,585 --> 00:56:06,350
Enough of your prattle, jackanapes!

939
00:56:06,351 --> 00:56:09,090
Your ** angers the heavens.

940
00:56:09,092 --> 00:56:12,600
I once went snowboarding with Joss Whedon so.

941
00:56:12,606 --> 00:56:16,800
The gods demand retribution!

942
00:56:45,801 --> 00:56:48,930
Bob, did you put the particle board by the curb?

943
00:56:48,936 --> 00:56:51,830
Jup.

944
00:56:57,348 --> 00:56:59,480
Arn't you supposed to be at work?

945
00:56:59,485 --> 00:57:02,500
I got the day off.

946
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:07,500
Well, you just can't sit around eating cereal all day.

947
00:57:07,509 --> 00:57:11,470
Watch me.

948
00:57:11,475 --> 00:57:14,180
I'll get it.

949
00:57:15,975 --> 00:57:19,430
Barbara? Mel Vernon.

950
00:57:19,433 --> 00:57:23,290
Actually, today might not be the best day let me give you a call this evening i think that...

951
00:57:23,293 --> 00:57:25,010
What's going on? Who's this?

952
00:57:25,018 --> 00:57:27,020
I'm Mel Vernon, the appraiser.

953
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,830
— Scott, why don't you go back in the house...
— The what?

954
00:57:28,836 --> 00:57:30,710
and finish your breakfast?

955
00:57:30,714 --> 00:57:32,360
The appraiser.

956
00:57:32,362 --> 00:57:35,870
Services not needed!

957
00:57:35,877 --> 00:57:36,940
Scott.

958
00:57:36,949 --> 00:57:38,190
Goddamnit!

959
00:57:38,194 --> 00:57:41,990
The moment you said you were coming here, i knew something was up.

960
00:57:41,996 --> 00:57:43,370
Scott, calm down...

961
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:45,750
I'm sorry to throw a wrench in your evil schemes,

962
00:57:45,758 --> 00:57:47,280
but this house is mine!

963
00:57:47,285 --> 00:57:48,760
Nana said so!

964
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:50,770
Can't you two wait until i'm dead

965
00:57:50,773 --> 00:57:52,840
to fight over my shit?

966
00:57:52,847 --> 00:57:53,960
Nana.

967
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,600
Mom, you should be resting.

968
00:57:55,606 --> 00:57:57,610
Well, if somebody would check up on me every now and then,

969
00:57:57,617 --> 00:57:59,230
i wouldn't have to come out here.

970
00:57:59,231 --> 00:58:01,560
My body could have been decomposing

971
00:58:01,568 --> 00:58:03,730
for the last four hours, for all you knew.

972
00:58:03,732 --> 00:58:05,770
I was just going...

973
00:58:05,772 --> 00:58:08,679
Nana.

974
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:13,160
Nana, i don't like to say "i told you so", but, i fucking told you so.

975
00:58:13,163 --> 00:58:14,970
She's trying to sell the house.

976
00:58:14,978 --> 00:58:18,040
Oh Scott, don't be paranoid.

977
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,830
Oh, yeah? Why was there an appraiser just here?

978
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:23,330
And why did she try to hide it from me?

979
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:26,450
An appraiser?

980
00:58:27,207 --> 00:58:30,910
You had an appraiser come to my house?

981
00:58:30,912 --> 00:58:34,210
What's the big deal? Everyone should know what their house is worth.

982
00:58:34,216 --> 00:58:37,910
Cut the shit, Barbara.

983
00:58:41,994 --> 00:58:43,760
Bob is a great guy.

984
00:58:43,761 --> 00:58:48,260
He's kind, he's stable, he's not terribly interesting,

985
00:58:48,261 --> 00:58:52,720
but he loves me and he wants to marry me.

986
00:58:52,725 --> 00:58:55,100
But...

987
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:59,370
But i have alot of debt.

988
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:00,950
And Bob doesn't know.

989
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:03,050
Not the extent of it.

990
00:59:03,055 --> 00:59:06,750
And i don't know what he'll do if he finds out...

991
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:16,670
I swear i wasn't going to do anything without your permission.

992
00:59:16,675 --> 00:59:18,740
I was just waiting for the right time.

993
00:59:18,743 --> 00:59:21,130
So what do you want?

994
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:25,000
I sell the house to pay your debt, and Scott and i live on the street?

995
00:59:25,002 --> 00:59:27,820
No.

996
00:59:35,468 --> 00:59:37,550
An old folks home.

997
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:40,480
Sandy Point retirement community

998
00:59:40,487 --> 00:59:42,640
It's very exclusive.

999
00:59:42,644 --> 00:59:46,980
But Bob's cousin is the manager, and he said he could get you in immediately.

1000
00:59:46,985 --> 00:59:48,420
And best of all,

1001
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:51,050
It's just two blocks from our place in Flagstaff.

1002
00:59:51,057 --> 00:59:53,620
So i could visit you every day.

1003
00:59:53,626 --> 00:59:55,860
You are not buying this crap, are you Nana?

1004
00:59:55,864 --> 00:59:58,060
Once she gets the money, we're not gonna see her again.

1005
00:59:58,065 --> 01:00:00,400
Scott, you don't know me as well as you think you do.

1006
01:00:00,401 --> 01:00:01,740
Yeah, who's fault is that?

1007
01:00:01,749 --> 01:00:05,040
Oh, shut up, both of you.

1008
01:00:17,825 --> 01:00:22,220
Scott, sit down... sit down!

1009
01:00:24,837 --> 01:00:29,750
I know you don't have a very high opinion of your mother,

1010
01:00:29,756 --> 01:00:33,250
but she's my daughter and she's asking for my help.

1011
01:00:33,259 --> 01:00:35,880
But you said i could have the house.

1012
01:00:35,886 --> 01:00:38,520
You promised.

1013
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:42,770
Well, unfortunately for you, it's still my house

1014
01:00:42,776 --> 01:00:47,190
And i still get to decide what to do with it.

1015
01:00:51,339 --> 01:00:52,940
But that's not fair.

1016
01:00:52,943 --> 01:00:55,610
I've been taking care of you all these years, putting up with your shit.

1017
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:57,410
Excuse me!

1018
01:00:57,413 --> 01:01:00,660
Who's taking care of who?

1019
01:01:00,663 --> 01:01:03,490
How much rent do you pay, huh?

1020
01:01:03,496 --> 01:01:06,290
Who buys all the groceries, look at me.

1021
01:01:06,294 --> 01:01:10,420
And cooks the food and does the laundry.

1022
01:01:10,426 --> 01:01:12,160
I do the laundry sometimes.

1023
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:14,230
Jesus Christ!

1024
01:01:14,238 --> 01:01:16,610
When your grandfather was your age

1025
01:01:16,613 --> 01:01:18,830
he had a family, a business

1026
01:01:18,838 --> 01:01:21,620
and a house he built himself.

1027
01:01:21,629 --> 01:01:25,820
Thank god he's not still here to see how his only grandson turned out.

1028
01:01:25,821 --> 01:01:29,546
Yeah, wasn't he a drunk too?

1029
01:01:29,546 --> 01:01:33,160
Don't you ever talk about your grandfather like that.

1030
01:01:33,165 --> 01:01:35,260
This isn't over, you hear me?

1031
01:01:35,267 --> 01:01:37,730
You're not getting away with this, either of you.

1032
01:01:37,738 --> 01:01:40,670
I'm getting a lawyer and i'm suing your asses.

1033
01:01:40,674 --> 01:01:44,970
And maybe i'll have you declared incontinent, for good measure.

1034
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:44,980
Mr. Goran, we'll be ready for you in about 10 minutes, okay?

1035
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:48,550
Your internet connection sucks.

1036
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:53,070
"Let's rock and roll"!

1037
01:03:00,019 --> 01:03:02,610
Shit!

1038
01:03:04,793 --> 01:03:08,600
Well, well, well. I didn't think you'd come.

1039
01:03:08,606 --> 01:03:10,390
Well it's a special ocassion.

1040
01:03:10,397 --> 01:03:12,500
Yeah, i'll say.

1041
01:03:12,502 --> 01:03:15,300
Do you know this is Greg's first public appearance in 15 years.

1042
01:03:15,306 --> 01:03:17,240
Yeah, that's right.

1043
01:03:17,244 --> 01:03:18,870
He asked me to call him Greg.

1044
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:23,370
Pete, i wanna apologize to you for how i've behaved.

1045
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:33,970
I was very angry when Huey made you assistant manager.

1046
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:37,570
To be honest, i thought you were completely unqualified.

1047
01:03:37,579 --> 01:03:38,770
But...

1048
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:43,440
Looks like, i was wrong.

1049
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,760
Looks like...

1050
01:03:44,761 --> 01:03:46,520
Anyway.

1051
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:52,240
I'm sorry i let that get in the way of our friendship.

1052
01:03:55,527 --> 01:03:58,290
Okay... allright.

1053
01:03:59,299 --> 01:04:02,200
Thanks Scott.

1054
01:04:02,206 --> 01:04:05,430
Can i have my old job back?

1055
01:04:08,814 --> 01:04:11,220
Seriously. Can i have my old job back?

1056
01:04:11,226 --> 01:04:12,050
Scott.

1057
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:14,210
Scott, you're hurting me.

1058
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:16,330
You're hurting me now.

1059
01:04:16,334 --> 01:04:17,140
Pete. Please.

1060
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:18,410
Let go!

1061
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:20,370
Pete...

1062
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:23,550
I really need this.

1063
01:04:24,551 --> 01:04:29,185
Look, just talk to me after the Q&A, okay?

1064
01:04:29,185 --> 01:04:32,630
Sure, sounds great.

1065
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:35,740
I'll help you clean up.

1066
01:04:44,398 --> 01:04:48,860
Hello. Hello. Good afternoon everybody.

1067
01:04:48,867 --> 01:04:50,840
For those that don't know my guest

1068
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:54,160
i'd like to say a few words.

1069
01:04:57,981 --> 01:05:03,960
Greg Goran's association with tabletop games goes back

1070
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:10,170
He was one of the first historical war strategy game testers

1071
01:05:10,179 --> 01:05:14,710
In 1989, he became a contributing editor on the Hunter-Gatherer system,

1072
01:05:14,716 --> 01:05:17,240
and later he helped found the CRPG

1073
01:05:17,242 --> 01:05:19,570
and authored two of his own original games,

1074
01:05:19,579 --> 01:05:22,110
Battle Scourge and Machine Blood.

1075
01:05:22,115 --> 01:05:24,170
"Battle Scourge"!

1076
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:27,280
He's here today to share some of that history with us, as well as sign

1077
01:05:27,287 --> 01:05:28,330


1078
01:05:28,335 --> 01:05:30,910
That's only on products purchased today in the store, ok?

1079
01:05:30,915 --> 01:05:35,410
So, let's give a big hand for Greg Goran.

1080
01:05:41,341 --> 01:05:44,540
Hey everyone. Great to see you guys could pull yourselves away

1081
01:05:44,548 --> 01:05:46,840
from World of Warcraft for an afternoon.

1082
01:05:46,849 --> 01:05:50,680
Maybe there is hope after all.

1083
01:05:50,683 --> 01:05:52,330
Now how do you wanna do this?

1084
01:05:52,334 --> 01:05:54,310
I thought you might have something to say

1085
01:05:54,315 --> 01:05:56,060
before we get to the questions.

1086
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:58,150
Nah.

1087
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:01,780
Okay. Questions then. Are there any questions?

1088
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:03,030
Yes.

1089
01:06:03,034 --> 01:06:04,540
Hi Mr. Goran.

1090
01:06:04,548 --> 01:06:08,160
I was wondering why the editors of edition 2 chose to lessen

1091
01:06:08,163 --> 01:06:12,280
the move penalty from marshland from -6 to -3.

1092
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:15,280
Well, if you read the second edition a bit more attentively you'd know that

1093
01:06:15,281 --> 01:06:18,160
that was changed to reflect the new movement ratio so

1094
01:06:18,162 --> 01:06:20,140
the penalty is essentially the same.

1095
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:23,140
Any intelligent questions?

1096
01:06:26,966 --> 01:06:29,010
You.

1097
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:31,910
Hi, i'm an independent RPG designer.

1098
01:06:31,918 --> 01:06:34,690
And i've submitted some of my own games to various publishers,

1099
01:06:34,695 --> 01:06:38,440
but i haven't caught a break yet. Do you have an advise for me?

1100
01:06:38,444 --> 01:06:41,780
Write better games, i guess.

1101
01:06:41,786 --> 01:06:43,520
Okay...

1102
01:06:43,528 --> 01:06:46,510
Are there any other questions.

1103
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:54,890
Scott.

1104
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:56,430
Thank you.

1105
01:06:56,430 --> 01:07:00,840
Mr. Goran, in your 1992 adventure module "Spires of Doom",

1106
01:07:00,849 --> 01:07:04,250
the character of the ice sorceress was so fully realized that,

1107
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:07,420
I thought she must have been based on a real person.

1108
01:07:07,428 --> 01:07:09,920
Is that accurate?

1109
01:07:10,333 --> 01:07:12,500
Actually, yes. My first wife.

1110
01:07:12,503 --> 01:07:15,540
Beautiful, clever, but the coldest bitch i've ever knew.

1111
01:07:15,549 --> 01:07:17,600
That's very perceptive.

1112
01:07:17,607 --> 01:07:18,350
Okay.

1113
01:07:18,356 --> 01:07:20,850
Also recently, my players told me that

1114
01:07:20,856 --> 01:07:24,360
i take the game too seriously.

1115
01:07:24,365 --> 01:07:29,380
Is that even possible for a game master to take his game too seriously?

1116
01:07:29,382 --> 01:07:32,910
Well, It's certainly important for a GM to be focussed and organized .

1117
01:07:32,914 --> 01:07:35,690
When i was running games fulltime back in the 80's,

1118
01:07:35,694 --> 01:07:38,540
i used to spend 20 hours a week in preparation.

1119
01:07:38,542 --> 01:07:40,950
Oh, me too, me too. At least 20.

1120
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:43,220
But at the end of the day, it's a game.

1121
01:07:43,223 --> 01:07:48,080
It's a way to socialize, relax and have fun.

1122
01:07:48,088 --> 01:07:51,530
you know, and you can get that with 20 hours of prep or 2.

1123
01:07:51,533 --> 01:07:53,280
Ok, moving on.

1124
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,960
Yeah, well, don't you think there is more to it than that?

1125
01:07:55,962 --> 01:07:57,160
So, moving on...

1126
01:07:57,163 --> 01:07:59,200
I mean, if it's just about having fun,

1127
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:01,210
why not play tiddlywinks?

1128
01:08:01,213 --> 01:08:01,520
Scott enough.

1129
01:08:01,522 --> 01:08:04,620
RPG's are more rewarding, because of what they ask of you.

1130
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:06,700
Look, amigo bottom line,

1131
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:09,480
you're the game master, the buck stops with you!

1132
01:08:09,488 --> 01:08:11,600
If your players arn't having fun,

1133
01:08:11,606 --> 01:08:14,700
you're not doing your job.

1134
01:08:14,707 --> 01:08:17,430
Well that's fucking ridiculous!

1135
01:08:17,431 --> 01:08:18,570
Scott!

1136
01:08:18,579 --> 01:08:19,830
Not doing my job?

1137
01:08:19,835 --> 01:08:22,110
I put my heart and soul into the game.

1138
01:08:22,114 --> 01:08:24,860
No game master works harder than me!

1139
01:08:24,863 --> 01:08:26,240
That's it, you're out of here.

1140
01:08:26,241 --> 01:08:27,780
I think somebody needs to get a life.

1141
01:08:27,789 --> 01:08:29,430
You get a life!

1142
01:08:29,434 --> 01:08:31,730
Battle Scourge sucks shit!

1143
01:08:31,735 --> 01:08:35,260
I said get out. And don't come back!

1144
01:08:35,265 --> 01:08:38,660
Oh boo hoo. This place sucks anyways.

1145
01:08:38,669 --> 01:08:42,470
It's a joke. This guy doesn't know how to run a game store.

1146
01:08:42,471 --> 01:08:44,840
The only reason he's the assistant manager,

1147
01:08:44,849 --> 01:08:48,450
is because he's fucking Huey's ugly ass sister.

1148
01:08:48,451 --> 01:08:49,820
Oh, Yeah?

1149
01:08:49,829 --> 01:08:52,840
Well, at least i didn't let the cash register get robbed

1150
01:08:52,847 --> 01:08:57,340
because i was in the back room jerking off to anime.

1151
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:03,440
That just didn't happen. I...

1152
01:09:03,444 --> 01:09:05,450
No idea what he's talking about, I... I...

1153
01:09:05,457 --> 01:09:08,240
I think it's weird that he would even imagine that scenario.

1154
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:11,360
Would you like to see the security tapes? Because, you know, i kept them.

1155
01:09:11,366 --> 01:09:14,550
Oh, my!

1156
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,080
Bullshit.

1157
01:09:16,089 --> 01:09:19,480
How many people here have allready seen the tapes?

1158
01:09:22,285 --> 01:09:25,280
No it isn't true.

1159
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:31,810
It's not true!

1160
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:53,510
Why? Why? Why am i shit on constantly?

1161
01:09:53,516 --> 01:09:56,320
This world is a fucked up place, with fucked up people,

1162
01:09:56,328 --> 01:10:00,820
who's only goal is to fucking ruin my life!

1163
01:10:01,436 --> 01:10:04,170
Well i'll show you motherfucker.

1164
01:10:04,173 --> 01:10:06,400
You want a game? You want my game?

1165
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,950
I'll give you a game to play motherfuckers.

1166
01:10:09,952 --> 01:10:14,480
Yeah, I'll show you a fucking game to play.

1167
01:11:06,361 --> 01:11:08,960
Excuse me.

1168
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,900
Do you know where Miles is?

1169
01:11:13,503 --> 01:11:16,160
He was here just a second ago.

1170
01:11:16,163 --> 01:11:19,040
Are you a friend of his?

1171
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,220
He's my nemesis.

1172
01:11:22,223 --> 01:11:23,560
Hum...

1173
01:11:23,568 --> 01:11:25,180
Okay.

1174
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:30,510
He thinks he's won, but we'll see who has the last laugh.

1175
01:11:31,661 --> 01:11:33,970
Right on.

1176
01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:37,390
I'm Kevin.

1177
01:11:37,869 --> 01:11:38,880
Scott.

1178
01:11:38,881 --> 01:11:42,640
Do you want a beer man ?

1179
01:11:42,641 --> 01:11:44,270
Yeah, that's wonderful.

1180
01:11:44,277 --> 01:11:46,230
Are you involved in that as well?

1181
01:11:46,230 --> 01:11:48,740
No?

1182
01:11:50,922 --> 01:11:52,390
She still works there, you know?

1183
01:11:52,396 --> 01:11:54,980
I know.

1184
01:11:54,984 --> 01:11:57,990
Miles... Miles.

1185
01:12:03,538 --> 01:12:06,430
What the fuck?

1186
01:12:14,251 --> 01:12:15,580
Hello?

1187
01:12:15,586 --> 01:12:16,640
Hey, Wayne?

1188
01:12:16,644 --> 01:12:18,420
I need you to do me a favor.

1189
01:12:18,423 --> 01:12:19,540
Sure, anything.

1190
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:21,110
I need you to come to my house

1191
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:22,530
and come get Scott.

1192
01:12:22,531 --> 01:12:24,920
Why is Scott in your house?

1193
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:27,080
Well... he...

1194
01:12:27,087 --> 01:12:28,960
kinda crashed my party, and...

1195
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,520
he's been drinking, and...

1196
01:12:30,527 --> 01:12:33,420
You're having a party?

1197
01:12:35,047 --> 01:12:37,560
Uhh..yeah.

1198
01:12:38,492 --> 01:12:41,340
Oh...

1199
01:12:41,342 --> 01:12:42,890
So, can you come get him?

1200
01:12:42,896 --> 01:12:46,210
Yeah, Yeah, okay, i'll be right there.

1201
01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:48,840
Thanks, bye.

1202
01:12:53,175 --> 01:12:54,700
Ah! If this were medieval times,

1203
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:58,720
i'd be well within my rights to challenge him to armed combat.

1204
01:12:58,726 --> 01:13:01,440
If that were to happen?

1205
01:13:02,874 --> 01:13:05,080
Spill his guts all over the floor.

1206
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,590
It's called the code of chivalry.

1207
01:13:07,597 --> 01:13:08,670
May i?

1208
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:09,720
Yeah, sure.

1209
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,000
Well, i think it's refreshing

1210
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,900
that people still have nemisis's these days.

1211
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:17,650
You know, i mean you dont hear that much anymore.

1212
01:13:17,657 --> 01:13:18,930
Nemesēs.

1213
01:13:18,939 --> 01:13:21,560
Jup, those were the good old days.

1214
01:13:21,561 --> 01:13:25,900
Back when men were expected to answer for their actions.

1215
01:13:25,904 --> 01:13:27,800
There he is!

1216
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:32,410
Miles, you never told us you had a nemesis.

1217
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:38,000
Scott, what are you doing here?

1218
01:13:38,002 --> 01:13:39,870
Just came to party man!

1219
01:13:39,874 --> 01:13:43,890
Drink some brewski's, talk some shit...

1220
01:13:45,681 --> 01:13:49,900
Say, where's Wayne and Martin and Leonard?

1221
01:13:49,904 --> 01:13:52,190
Why arn't they here?

1222
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:56,320
Oh, their invitations must have got lost in the mail.

1223
01:13:57,462 --> 01:14:00,790
Uh Scott, why don't we talk about this tomorrow?

1224
01:14:00,796 --> 01:14:03,720
Whatever is going on between us, you know, we can work out.

1225
01:14:03,723 --> 01:14:05,470
Wait, Wait...

1226
01:14:05,475 --> 01:14:09,130
Arn't you gonna challenge him?

1227
01:14:09,133 --> 01:14:13,640
Arn't you gonna challenge him to a duel?

1228
01:14:14,253 --> 01:14:17,010
Yes! Thank you Kevin.

1229
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:18,830
Miles!

1230
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:23,400
I challenge you to a contest of armed combat.

1231
01:14:23,402 --> 01:14:25,240
Come on Scott. Don't do this.

1232
01:14:25,243 --> 01:14:29,850
You and me settling our differences on the field of battle.

1233
01:14:29,858 --> 01:14:31,630
Fuck yeah!

1234
01:14:31,639 --> 01:14:34,150
Scott, i'm not gonna fight you.

1235
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:37,780
Not for real Miles. We'll just give them a demonstration, okay?

1236
01:14:37,789 --> 01:14:40,120
You guys wanna see a demonstration?

1237
01:14:40,123 --> 01:14:42,190
Oh, hell yeah!

1238
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:44,070
Ladies and gentlemen,

1239
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:48,720
we're going to give you a demonstration on ancient sword techniques.

1240
01:14:48,725 --> 01:14:53,170
Don't worry, i'm an expert on medieval combat and weaponry.

1241
01:14:53,175 --> 01:14:55,190
Here man.

1242
01:14:55,193 --> 01:14:56,770
Ah, yes.

1243
01:14:56,772 --> 01:14:59,180
A two handed broadsword.

1244
01:14:59,187 --> 01:15:03,680
My compliments to the smith who forged this true steel.

1245
01:15:06,058 --> 01:15:10,360
No, i'm not gonna fight you. This guy is fucking crazy.

1246
01:15:10,366 --> 01:15:13,870
I'm not gonna hurt you Miles. It's just for fun.

1247
01:15:13,879 --> 01:15:17,100
Just do this and i'll leave, okay?

1248
01:15:19,144 --> 01:15:20,900
Come on Miles.

1249
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:22,260
Do it you fucking pussy, come on.

1250
01:15:22,261 --> 01:15:25,290
Back up son!

1251
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:28,330
Take your weapon, sir.

1252
01:15:31,101 --> 01:15:33,800
Son of a bitch.

1253
01:15:35,963 --> 01:15:39,790
Allright, the targets on the human body are as follows,

1254
01:15:39,795 --> 01:15:41,990
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1255
01:15:41,993 --> 01:15:44,240


1256
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,920
— Wait...
— I'm gonna call out a series of attacks.

1257
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,680
You be ready to defend,okay?

1258
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:51,070
— Wait.
— 2, 1, 5.
- 2, 1, 5.

1259
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:57,250
3, 2, 1.

1260
01:16:01,021 --> 01:16:03,920
4, 4, 2.

1261
01:16:08,695 --> 01:16:12,690
Very good Miles. You are a worthy opponent.

1262
01:16:12,698 --> 01:16:16,540
But a true warrior does not need a cheat sheet.

1263
01:16:16,545 --> 01:16:20,202
He must be ready to react!

1264
01:16:20,202 --> 01:16:23,030
Fuck!

1265
01:16:35,548 --> 01:16:39,949
You're just good at everything, arn't you Miles?

1266
01:16:39,949 --> 01:16:44,980
You took my game. You took my friends.

1267
01:16:44,986 --> 01:16:51,490
And you think you've won, but you don't know my power!

1268
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:04,840
Fuck, Scott!

1269
01:17:04,846 --> 01:17:08,040
You are hitting too hard!

1270
01:17:08,795 --> 01:17:13,290
The gods demand retribution!

1271
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:17,197
Oh my god, Miles!

1272
01:17:17,197 --> 01:17:19,810
Oh, shit.

1273
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:24,550
Oh, shit.

1274
01:17:24,551 --> 01:17:27,493
I'm sorry Miles.

1275
01:17:27,493 --> 01:17:31,020
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1276
01:17:31,792 --> 01:17:32,630
Miles!

1277
01:17:32,637 --> 01:17:35,610
I didn't take anything from you.

1278
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:38,730
It's your own goddamn fault no one likes you.

1279
01:17:38,732 --> 01:17:43,230
You pathetic piece of shit.

1280
01:17:47,784 --> 01:17:52,280
Get the fuck off me!

1281
01:18:06,209 --> 01:18:10,700
Miles.

1282
01:18:20,193 --> 01:18:25,490
Get the fuck out of my house, you goddamn nerds.

1283
01:19:34,701 --> 01:19:39,700
I can sleep over at your house and take you back to your car in the morning.

1284
01:19:40,039 --> 01:19:43,490
I think if i talk to the guys, we can get the game back together.

1285
01:19:43,493 --> 01:19:44,900
After i tell them what happend,

1286
01:19:44,908 --> 01:19:49,500
they're not gonna wanna play with Miles anymore. I'm pretty sure.

1287
01:19:51,722 --> 01:19:55,330
Did you ever go out with that girl, what's her name?

1288
01:19:55,336 --> 01:19:58,060
Beth. Yeah.

1289
01:19:58,062 --> 01:19:59,290
And?

1290
01:19:59,297 --> 01:20:01,360
You were right.

1291
01:20:01,368 --> 01:20:04,860
She hasn't called me back.

1292
01:20:05,541 --> 01:20:07,840
I wasn't right Wayne.

1293
01:20:07,847 --> 01:20:12,570
I only said that because i didn't want you to have a girlfriend.

1294
01:20:15,055 --> 01:20:17,650
Why?

1295
01:20:19,429 --> 01:20:24,330
Because i needed someone to be more of a loser than me.

1296
01:20:58,916 --> 01:21:01,360
Tastes like plastic.

1297
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:04,380
I'll take it if you don't want it.

1298
01:21:06,759 --> 01:21:08,930
How's your mother?

1299
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:10,960
She and Bob are fighting all the time now.

1300
01:21:10,965 --> 01:21:15,260
I pretty much just stay in my room.

1301
01:21:17,805 --> 01:21:20,520
I'll get her to come see you soon.

1302
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,230
Whatever.

1303
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:26,440
At least you're here.

1304
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:28,820
Alright.

1305
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:31,950
I gotta get back to work.

1306
01:21:37,033 --> 01:21:40,330
See you at dinner, right?

1307
01:21:47,347 --> 01:21:48,360
Hey Scott.

1308
01:21:48,363 --> 01:21:50,880
Hey Thomas.

1309
01:21:51,586 --> 01:21:54,180
Shit.

1310
01:22:02,272 --> 01:22:04,470
Irene, where are you going?

1311
01:22:04,474 --> 01:22:06,840
Just going to say hi to Angie.

1312
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,270
It's her birthday.

1313
01:22:08,278 --> 01:22:12,370
Well, next break is in an hour. You can say hi then.

1314
01:22:13,719 --> 01:22:15,800
Alright.

1315
01:22:15,809 --> 01:22:17,420
Where were we?

1316
01:22:17,421 --> 01:22:18,620
Ah, yes.

1317
01:22:18,627 --> 01:22:21,720
Hagavar the dextrous, has just been enchanted by the elf witch.

1318
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:25,690
Say, i never got my resistance throw.

1319
01:22:25,692 --> 01:22:28,630
I told you, Henry, dwarfs do not get a resistance throw

1320
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:32,490
against natural magic. Let's focus here.

1321
01:22:32,492 --> 01:22:36,680
I'm going to seduce her with my high charisma.

1322
01:22:36,683 --> 01:22:40,780
No, Burt, she destoyed your village remember?

1323
01:22:40,787 --> 01:22:42,120
You wouldn't wanna seduce her.

1324
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:43,760
Oh, i think i would...

1325
01:22:43,761 --> 01:22:49,060
Besides, her wisdom is too high. You need to roll a 20.

1326
01:22:57,779 --> 01:23:03,150
Alright, i'll say... 19.

1327
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:06,280
Good enough for me.

1328
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:23,350
Please, no.

1329
